		-X -n Java -v 1.0
1.1  
	 - Allow creation of primitive Java array types
	 - Allow Strings to be created using encodings for Localization
		w/':string_<ENCODING>' syntax
	 - Allow integers to be strings w/':string' syntax
1.12
	- Refined string encoding stuff
1.13
	- Added 'static_call' function to make static method calls on
		classes NOT in packages.
1.14
	- Just setsockopt SO_REUSEADDR on Java.pm event_server port
2.0
	8/23/00
	- Now using ctrl-A to separate parameter lists so we can accept
