Revision history for Perl extension Java.

1.0  Fri Apr 28 16:36:29 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-X -n Java -v 1.0
1.1  
	 - Allow creation of primitive Java array types
	 - Allow Strings to be created using encodings for Localization
		w/':string_<ENCODING>' syntax
	 - Allow integers to be strings w/':string' syntax
1.12
	- Refined string encoding stuff
1.13
	- Added 'static_call' function to make static method calls on
		classes NOT in packages.
1.14
	- Just setsockopt SO_REUSEADDR on Java.pm event_server port
2.0
	8/23/00
	- Now using ctrl-A to separate parameter lists so we can accept
		commas or any other printable character in strings.
		THIS CHANGE MEANS NEITHER JAVASERVER NOR JAVA.PM ARE
			COMPATIBLE WITH ANY 1.X RELEASE!!
		(hence the bump up of the major version number!)

Java stuff got updated to 2.1 - Perl stuff still at 2.0
        1/24/01
        - Included Andreas Leue's code to statically start and stop
                JavaServer from within an already-running Java app
                Check out 'test_test.pl' in the Perl examples directory
                so see what this looks like on the Perl side.  Pretty
                much the same!
                On the Java side you can now use 'JavaServer.start()',
                or 'JavaServer.start(int port)' to specify a port other
                than 2000 to programmatically start JavaServer & you
                similarly use 'JavaServer.stop()' to stop the madness
                when you've had enough fun.
                Like:

                public class MyApp
                {
                        public static void main(String args[])
                        {
                                // Allow JavaServer to 'hook' into
                                //      your running program
                                JavaServer.start();


                                // Do whatever yer program does

                                // Done
                                JavaServer.stop();
                        }
                }
        - Fixed stupid bug about the MANIFEST file looking for Java.jar
                when it's really called JavaServer.jar

Perl stuff up to 2.1 - Java stuff the same
	2/22/01
	- Fixed bug in 'static_call' so it now uses PARAMETER_SEPARATOR
		(thanks to David Roth)
	- Fixed bugs in java_server_install.pl to correctly reference 
		'JavaServer.jar' & not 'Java.jar'
		(thanks to Slavan Rezic & David Roth)
Perl stuff up to 2.2 - Java stuff the same
	3/9/01
	- Overloaded '==' to be the same as the 'same' function.
		So instead of having to do:
			if ($obj1.same($obj2))
		You can now do:
			if ($obj1 == $obj2)
		Check out the perldoc.
	- Added JavaArray tied interface for Java arrays!
		See 'perldoc Java' for all the glorious details!
		It's very cool!  See 'array.pl' in 'examples' directory
		for example usage.
	- Some other random bug fixes for the install stuff
