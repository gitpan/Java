Examples in this directory demonstrate how your Java classes can evalutate perl expressions.

The expressions need to evaluate to a true value - check out SelfRunning.java
where some subroutine perl code is first eval'ed into the package SelfRunning,
note there's a '1' on the end there to force it to eval to true.

Also the whole thing just returns Strings - no fancy object stuff like
from Perl to Java

ALL OF THIS STUFF IS VERY EXPERIMENTAL!!!
LET ME KNOW IF YOU COME UP WITH ANY GOOD APPLICATIONS OF THIS FEATURE!
